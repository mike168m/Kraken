Kraken is an opensource header only c library for writing multicore 
multithread programs using green threads on x86 (Linux, Windows & MacOSX), AVR amd ARM.
!!! WARNING: Implementation in progress
    Use at your own risk.
## Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Bash
wget -O [your_include_dir]/kraken.h https://git.io/Je4U2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Example
***
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~C
#define  KRAKEN_SCHEDULER    0x01
#define  KRAKEN_MAX_THREADS  0x04
#include "kraken.h"

// 1.a. Define a function that represents a thread.
KRAKEN_THREAD_FUNCTION( first_thread,
{
    static int var_1 = 0;
    while ( TRUE ) 
    {
        // do some work
        var_1 += 1;
        printf( "In thread 1. var_1 = %d.\n", var_1 );
        kraken_yield( runtime );
    }
})

// 1.b. Define a second function for a second thread to make things more interesting.
KRAKEN_THREAD_FUNCTION( second_thread,
{
    static int var_2 = 0;
    while ( TRUE )
    {
      // do some other work.
      var_2 += 2;
      printf( "In thread 2. var_2 = %d.\n", var_2 );
      kraken_yield( runtime );
    } 
})

int main ( void )
{
    // 2. Create a new single core kraken runtime.
    // A runtime is responsible creating and managing threads on a cpu core.
    struct kraken_runtime* my_runtime = kraken_initialize_runtime();
    // 3. Use these predefined macros to schedule your threads to be run.
    KRAKEN_SCHEDULE_THREAD( my_runtime, first_thread );
    KRAKEN_SCHEDULE_THREAD( my_runtime, second_thread );
    // 4. Next we start the runtime and specify a return value for main.
    kraken_run( runtime, 0 );
}

## Internals
***
A processor is always executing one instruction from a process at any point in time 
but modern
systems make it seems as if a gazillion are being executed at the same time.
This isn't the
case but rather the result of excellent engineering by those working on these systems.
Today's operating and CPUs use nifty tricks to quickly switch between processes
or blocks of instructions to give the appearance multiple processes running 
at the same time.

***********************************************************************
This "switch" is called a context switch. During each switch the processor state
(registers,
stack pointer etc) is saved for use later and new values are loaded to execute a 
new process.
This operation varies between various operating systems and this is just a general 
overview
of it.

Fortunately, modern operating systems have this functionality built into them.
There's even a good chance your programming language comes with support for threads
So why does kraken exist? 
## Structs & Enums
***
### kraken_context
Represents the state of a thread during program execution.
Please see descriptions of expected states below.
```
struct kraken_context
{
#if KRAKEN_ARCH == KRAKEN_ARCH_X86_64
    uint64_t    rsp;
    uint64_t    r15;
    uint64_t    r14;
    uint64_t    r13;
    uint64_t    rbx;
    uint64_t    rbp;
...
#elif KRAKEN_ARCH == KRAKEN_ARCH_X86
    uint32_t    esp;
    uint32_t    ebx;
