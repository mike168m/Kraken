### Kraken
---
[Implementation in progress]
Kraken is a c library for using providing green threads on x86 and AVR platforms.
Technically the term green threads only make sense on x86 and platforms that can support an
OS similar to windows or linux. I'm only implementing the library for avr cause I think its
an interesting project.
